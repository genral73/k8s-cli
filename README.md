# Install, Set Up and Overview kubectl
## Install kubectl on Linux
#### Install kubectl binary with curl on Linux
1. Download the latest release with the command, for example, to download version v1.18.0 on Linux, type:
```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.18.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```
2. Make the kubectl binary executable.
```bash
chmod +x ./kubectl
```
3. Move the binary in to your PATH.
```bash
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```
4. Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:
```bash
kubectl version --client
```
#### OR Install it using native package management
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https gnupg2
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
```

## Setup kubectl on Linux
#### Verifying kubectl configuration
  - In order for kubectl to find and access a Kubernetes cluster, it needs a kubeconfig file, which is created automatically when you create a cluster using  a [Kind](https://github.com/genral73/k8s-kind) or [Minikube](https://github.com/genral73/k8s-minikube) clusters.
  - By default, kubectl configuration is located at ~/.kube/config.

1. Check that kubectl is properly configured by getting the cluster state:
```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```
- If you see a message similar to the following, kubectl is not configured correctly or is not able to connect to a Kubernetes cluster.

>   output: The connection to the server <server-name:port> was refused - did you specify the right host or port?

#### Optional, enabling shell autocompletion
##### The completion script depends on bash-completion, which means that you have to install this software first:
1. Install bash-completion
```bash
apt-get install bash-completion
```
2. if the command succeeds, youâ€™re already set, otherwise add the following to your ~/.bashrc file:
```
source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
```
3. Reload your shell and verify that bash-completion is correctly installed by typing type:
```bash
type _init_completion
```

##### You now need to ensure that the kubectl completion script gets sourced in all your shell sessions:
1. Source the completion script in your ~/.bashrc file:
```bash
echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
```
2. If you have an alias for kubectl, you can extend shell completion to work with that alias:
```bash
echo 'alias k=kubectl' >>~/.bashrc
echo 'complete -F __start_kubectl k' >>~/.bashrc
```
